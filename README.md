CPSC 233 Final Project

Inventory Management System App. Coded for javac 18.0.2 and javafx-sdk-18.0.2 (most current versions as of writing), so ensure version are up to date to run the 
application. Application includes a plain-text file where the inventory is stored from each use of the app so that when the user reopens, the inventory has 
not been lost. Current class diagram is also included in the GitHub repository for reference. Enjoy!
