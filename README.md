CPSC 233 Final Project

Currently in progress. Only manage inventory track is currently somewhat functioning. Has a table where values can be added to be added to an Inventory database. Currently
doesn't have input validation (currently in progress) that will only correct entries into the table (currently, an error message is thrown). Plan for the rest of the day/
weekend is to add input validation and the ability to edit inventory (database) values and to have that be a validated process. Next, to create a create order section
that checks current inventory to make sure that the order is possible. Order will also tally total cost, tax, etc.. Once an order is made, the inventory will be modified accordingly. Finally, the review orders section
will be an area to review previous orders made, including the number of orders the orders' finances (e.g., profit, cost, etc.).
